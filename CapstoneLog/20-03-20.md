## Current Progress
Created the [`Song`](../blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Song.cs) `ScriptableObject`
and the [`Conductor`](../blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Conductor.cs) object that
handles the rhythm of the entire game.

The purpose of `Song` is to contain all the metadata of songs including, but not limited to, BPM, the song cover visual,
offset (`.mp4` files don't start imeediately due to the beginning of their data being metadata).
